-- global_data is a BPS patch file, to be created by Lunar Helper, that will hold the overworld, ex global animations, credits, and intro screen. You will work on these things from the built output ROM in Lunar Magic, then use the "S - Save" option in Lunar Helper to save your changes to this BPS file so that they appear in your next build.
