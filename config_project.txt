-- this is an example project file
-- Lunar Helper will use every config_*.txt file in its directory,
-- for a solo project, you could simply configure everything in one config file
-- but for collabs, it's a good idea to split configs between things that 
-- are relative to the project path and tools like Lunar Magic that each
-- editor may have installed at a different location, as in this example
-- (see config_user.txt for the rest of the example configuration)
 
-- if defined, the initial patch will be applied before any other steps
-- It's good idea to open your clean ROM in Lunar Magic, save it to another location, and create a patch
-- of that saved ROM. This lets Lunar Magic apply a VRAM patch that will be required for some things

-- global_data is a BPS patch file, to be created by Lunar Helper, 
-- that will hold the overworld, ex global animations, credits, intro screen, and title moves.
-- You will work on these things from the built output ROM in Lunar Magic, 
-- then use the "S - Save" option in Lunar Helper to save your changes to this BPS file so that they appear in your next build.
