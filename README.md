# Lunar Helper
 A tiny build system for Lunar Magic projects

 **Important Note:** This project has seen little maintenance and as such, Underway has taken up the torch of pushing forward SMW build systems with their project [Callisto](https://github.com/Underrout/callisto). I'm very glad that Lunar Helper inspired SMW hackers to pursue build systems, and I would highly recommend using Callisto or other alternatives rather than Lunar Helper.
